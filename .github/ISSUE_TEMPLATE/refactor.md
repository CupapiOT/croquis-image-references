description: This template is meant for larger refactors that have a significant effect on the codebase. For minor refactors or tweaks, issues may not be necessary.

**Summary**
Highlight the current state of the code that needs refactoring, such as overlapping functionalities between two functions, or confusing code that needs to be heavily restructured. Ex: Function A performs X, Y, Z; Function B performs Y, Z, W.

**Context**
Describe why this needs to be refactored, and potential problems that could arise if not. Mention any related issues, PRs, or documentation. Ex: Redundancy in Function A and B leads to maintenance challenges, inconsistent implementation, and inefficiencies.

**Implementation Plan**
Describe what the end-result should look like after the refactor. Ex: Function A and B combined into Function C, whilst the functionalities of X and Z have been moved to their respective use-cases.
Summarize the steps taken to achieve such an end result.
1. Analyze common and unique functionalities of Function A and Function B.
2. Design and implement Function C that integrates necessary components of both.
3. Replace calls to Function A and Function B with Function C.
4. Test to ensure the new function behaves as expected.

**Impact**
Describe the impact this refactor will have on the codebase, such as the benefits and any potential risks/challenges as well as how you plan to mitigate them.
