# How to fix the last directories not loading on launch:
1. Make sure that the "Load Last Folders On Launch" option is ticked on.
2. Open the preferences.txt file that should be there after the first time you open the app.
3. Look for " 'wait_directory_load': 0.0 " inside of it. This option ('wait_directory_load') controls the amount of time (measured in seconds) before the program loads your last saved directories; the default value is set to 0.0 seconds.
4. Change the 0.0 to a slightly higher number. (Example -->  'wait_directory_load': 0.15)
5. Save the file and restart the program. If the problem still remains, set it to a higher value. If even that doesn't work, then feel free to write an issue on the GitHub repository.
