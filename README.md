# DIY Croquis - Image References

A desktop application to help artists practice croquis (quick sketching) 
using their own references offline.

## Description

![Image References App Showcase](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad36978a-c101-48f2-97a4-77fb0317bda0)

A simple desktop application that anyone can use to practice croquis, using their own files from folders within their computer. The basic functionality &mdash; a timer and the ability to load files &mdash; are easy and intuitive to use.
Of course, you could also simply use it to go through your images one at a time.

This app was originally requested for the author to make by the author's brother; this app has now helped him and a few other artists practice croquis offline using their own set of references.

**Note**: This app offers a smooth-enough experience for regular (intended) use, but may run into performance issues when certain buttons/commands are spammed or when loading too many folders at once.

### Features
